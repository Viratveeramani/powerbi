In Excel, I cleaned the raw credit card data by removing duplicates, trimming spaces, fixing inconsistent formats, and converting text to proper formats. Using formulas like TRIM, IF, and built-in tools like Remove Duplicates and Flash Fill, I was able to prepare clean, consistent data before importing it into Power BI for dashboard creation."

HR DASHBOARD-POWER BI
In my HR dashboard, I tracked key KPIs like headcount, attrition rate, average tenure, and gender diversity. I used Power BI to connect HR data from Excel and SQL. I created DAX measures for attrition rate and tenure, and used visuals like bar charts and cards to highlight monthly trends. I also added slicers for department and location so HR teams could drill down easily. To handle sensitive data, I applied row-level security and published the report to Power BI Service with restricted access.


SALES DASHBOARD-POWER BI
"In my Sales Dashboard project, I used Power BI to visualize key sales KPIs like total revenue, YoY growth, and top-selling products. I used a star schema with Sales as the fact table and dimensions like Products, Customers, and Date. I created DAX measures to calculate dynamic sales growth and sales target achievement. The dashboard allowed filtering by region, time, and sales rep. I also implemented Row-Level Security to restrict regional access and published it to Power BI Service with scheduled refreshes."
